# Summary

**Command, Data Communication with Asynchronized Message Processing:**

This driver contains, at its' core, the inherent code capability of distinguishing<br /> between **Message** exchange and **Data** exchange between the connected MCU and<br /> Module devices.

The library supplies all required Application Programming Interfaces \(APIs\) required to<br /> create functional

implementation of operation a BLE connected end-device.

Through the MCC configuration the physical connection of the \(3\) required pins can be<br /> selected through the GUI.

These are the \(2\) UART pins used for communication, and control of the **RST\_N**<br /> connected to the RNBD Module.

Additionally; this Library allows for extension of Module pin behaviors through the<br /> simple RNBD Module object

interface; where any device/project specific instantiations exist.<br /> **rnbd\_interface.c/h**/**rn487x\_interface.c/h**

A brief description of the Interface, and object extension is described below:

iRNBD\_FunctionPtrs\_t is a typedef struct which can be found in<br /> **rnbd\_interface.h**/**rn487x\_interface.h** and consist of \(9\) function<br /> pointers. In the **rnbd\_interface.c**/**rn487x\_interface.c**, the concrete<br /> creation of RNBD as an object is instantiated. Within<br /> **rnbd\_interface.c**/**rn487x\_interface.c** are the **private static**<br /> implementations of desired behavior. In some cases, such as DELAY or UART, the<br /> supporting behavior is supplied through another supporting library module. When<br /> applicable ‘inline’ has been used to reduce stack depth overhead.

The driver library itself should not require any modifications or injections by the user;<br /> unless to expand upon the supported command implementations **rnbd.c/h**

**Configurable Module Hardware Requirement\(s\):**

A single UART instance used for communication between MCU and Module:

<br />

The Library allows for configuration of \(3\) Pins associated with support features<br /> extended through the Driver Interface. Only \(1\) Pin is required by the RNBD Modules for<br /> operation; this is the modules **RESET** pin.
