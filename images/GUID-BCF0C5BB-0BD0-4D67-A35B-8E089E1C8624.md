# Introduction:

The MPLAB® Code Configurator RNBD\(TBD\)/[RN487x](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/RN4870) BLE Modules Library allows quick and easy<br /> configuration of the C code generated software driver based upon the user’s selected API<br /> features available from the MCC Library. Generated Driver code supports use of either<br /> BLE Module with use of a PIC device.

The library module uses a Graphic User Interface \(GUI\) presented by MCC within MPLABX<br /> which allows for selection of desired configuration, and custom configurations of the<br /> protocol. Customized C code is generated within the MPLABX project, in a folder named<br /> "MCC Generated Files".

This Library uses \(1\) UART, \(1\) GPIO, and DELAY support at minimal.
